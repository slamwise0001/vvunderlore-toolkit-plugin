### Docs
Documentation for the Toolkit and plugin can be found here. You'll find information on how the Toolkit functions and ways to take advantage of all the plugin has to offer.
### Features
- The Toolkit: Installs the toolkit and allows updates via the plugin so you don't have to do a reinstall every time I make sweet sweet changes!
- Options to install rulesets (currently 2 versions of 5e but more to come as I figure it out)!
- Control over what files do and do not get updated allowing you to make changes to the way the toolkit works!
- Whole vault backups manually and/or before every update
### Notes on Installation
See below for a short demo.
- This works best in a fresh vault! Installing the toolkit in a populated vault will overwrite installed plugin configuration and may overwrite same-named files you may already have
- A ruleset is not required (select 'None') but most of the toolkit won't really work great then
- This will install and configure all necessary plugins for the toolkit to function
- There Will Be Bugs
##### If you want to do a manual installation for some reason:
>   1. Download the latest `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json` from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/slamwise0001/vvunderlore-toolkit-plugin/releases). 
>   2. Place them in `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/vvunderlore-toolkit-plugin/`.  
>   3. Restart Obsidian and enable the plugin.
